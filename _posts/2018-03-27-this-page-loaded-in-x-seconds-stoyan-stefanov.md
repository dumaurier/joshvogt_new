I love the idea of every website have a page load speedometer somewhere in the footer. [This post](https://www.phpied.com/this-page-loaded-in-x-seconds/), which references [Tim Kadlec's site](https://timkadlec.com/) grabs the code from Tim's site and turns into a handy bookmarklet.

This is the kind of transparency I'd like to see on big sites. I'd also like big sites to disclose how many external resources we're loaded and how many 3rd party trackers their site uses...but that will never, ever happen.
