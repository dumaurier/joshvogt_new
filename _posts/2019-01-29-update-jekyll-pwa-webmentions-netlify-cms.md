I've a new version of the Jekyll starter that includes fun things like a ready to go PWA, integration with Netlify CMS and WebMentions. 

The new version is on GitHub: [Jekyll + PWA + Netlify + Webmentions](https://github.com/dumaurier/pwa_jekyll)

As part of this I also changed the URL for posts which killed the existing webmentions. Though they were really just for demo purposes. The point is, I've got to resend a webmention to the new test page. Here it is: <https://pwa-jekyll-starter.netlify.com/posts/2018/this-is-a-test/>

So, if one were to follow that link then one would hopefully see a webmention from this site on the linked site.
